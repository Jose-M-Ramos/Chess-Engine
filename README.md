# Chess-Engine


## Acknowledgement 
As a chess player since primary school, I was inspired to create a chess program using Python. While searching for resources, I discovered a tutorial series by Eddie Sharick on the subject. I followed along with the videos and even made some improvements of my own(which are listed below). I highly recommend checking out the entire series on Eddie Sharick's YouTube channel.
